## Project 1 Airbnb Tableau Project

#### Technologies used
+ Tableau
+ XLSX
+ CSV

For this project I downloaded these [datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle) in a CSV format from *kaggle.com.* Then I combined them into one XLSX file as three sheets. Inside the Tableau I did inner join on two sheets.  

There are 5 vizualizations in final dashbord.
1. Average price bedroom
2. Distinct count of bedroom listings
3. Price per zipcode
4. Price by zipcode
5. Revenue for year  

Main point of these visualizations was to find most lucrative zipcode in Seattle area, best time of the year to rent, average renting price per number of bedrooms and competition basen on number of bedrooms.
